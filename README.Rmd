## Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations for DataSHIELD

The [`mice`](https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/mice) package
implements a popular method to deal with missing data. The package creates
multiple imputations (replacement values) for multivariate missing
data.

The [`DataSHIELD`](https://github.com/datashield) framework is a 
platform for federated data analysis that brings the algorithm to
the data. 

The [`miceds`](https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/miceds) package is an add-on to `mice` that makes multiple 
imputation available for federated data systems.

## Installation

The following code installs the `miceds` package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stefvanbuuren/miceds")
```

## Note

Warning: This is an experimental feature. These function do not yet actually work. If you have ideas about the integration of `mice` and `DataSHIELD` feel free to join in. 

## Related initiative

Related work appears in [`dsMice`](https://github.com/gflcampos/dsMice) and 
[`dsMiceClient`](https://github.com/gflcampos/dsMiceClient).

## Minimal example

    Include minimal example here using public DataSHIELD nodes.
